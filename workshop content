            <p class="big"> Building an engaged community on social media is essential for all brands, but for a start up a well executed social media strategy can be the difference between failure and success. Most start ups have very limited budgets and so rely heavily on social media to raise awareness of their brand or product. This workshop will introduce the various social media platforms, give you a solid understanding of what an <strong>effective Social Media strategy</strong> entails and how to maximise your exposure.
