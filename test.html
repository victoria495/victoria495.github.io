                 <p>With a few incredible entrepreneurs and Food StartUp School supporters by my side, our events bring together passionnate food and drinks entrepreneurs from London to give attendees the opportunity to gain valuable insights form the successes and sometimes also failures of fellow food entrepreneurs. Workshops provide <strong>concentrated learning</strong>, talks offer observations of similar journeys and open for discussion afterwards, and networking (plenty of it) creates the most effective way to bring the industry closer together by encouraging a <strong>collaborative environment</strong>. We're working with some incredible interational partners and sponsors this year, and I hope you're as excited as I am. </p>
